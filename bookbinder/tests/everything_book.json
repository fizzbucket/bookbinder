Such a circle does not breed Quixotes or reformers, and of few of us could it be said in the phrase of Villiers de l'Isle Adam, *il gardait au coeur les richesses stériles d'un grand nombre de rois oubliés*. I have known men like Hugh Dawnay and Francis Grenfell who would have ridden on a lost cause over the edge of the world.",
