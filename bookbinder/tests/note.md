I guess that here is as good a place as any to embark on the happy joy that is moving beyond the ASCII character set. It seems likely that some of the following characters will not be supported in a given font; we just want to check that there is some form of fallback or error handling rather than a fatal error.

Don't @ me, but it seems like the mediæval world and the Māori culture that was (at the initial settlement of New Zealand, its rough contemporary) bore similarities; I do not mean to say that these similarities are sufficient to make any fine claims, or that the fjords of Øresund and the fiords of Fiordland saw the same scenes of life and warfare, lived with the same élan with only incidental differences --- poi not fußball, waka not clinker-built ships --- in fact, I have no claims at all to make, I just wanted to use words with ligatures and accents from a variety of cultures.

Perhaps instead we should consider, for example, the Rus, straddlers of trade routes whom (Wikipedia helpfully tells me) were known as Рѹсь, Русь, Garðar or Ῥῶς depending on language.  Ῥῶς is certainly much shorter than Σκύθης!
