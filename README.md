# bookbinder

Create distributable books from markdown

This repository contains a group of rust crates
intended to allow the automated production of books
from a markdown source.
Currently PDF (via LaTeX) and EPUB output is supported.

A good place to begin with,
is the [documentation](https://docs.rs/bookbinder/latest/bookbinder/)
for the `bookbinder` crate.

Example output can be found
in [`bookbinder/test/test.pdf`](bookbinder/test/test.pdf)
and [`bookbinder/test/test.epub`](`bookbinder/test/test.epub).
