Create distributable books from markdown

This repository contains a group of rust crates intended to allow the automated production of books from a markdown source. Currently PDF (via LaTeX) and EPUB output is supported.

A good place to begin is with the (documentation)[https://docs.rs/bookbinder/latest/bookbinder/] for the `bookbinder` crate.
